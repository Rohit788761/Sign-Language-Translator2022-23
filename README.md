This project is a system that helps convert sign language into text or speech so that deaf or speech-impaired people can communicate easily with others.
It uses the Microsoft Kinect sensor to track hand and body movements in real time and then matches them with stored sign patterns.
The recognized signs are shown as text on the screen and can also be converted into speech for better communication.

Main Features:

1. Tracks hand, arm, and body movements using Kinect sensor
2. Recognizes predefined sign language gestures
3. Shows translated text on the screen
4. Option to speak out the translated text
5. Helps bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired and normal-hearing people

Future Features to Add:

1. Support for more signs and full sentence translation
2. Multi-language output for translated speech
3. AI-based gesture recognition for faster and more accurate results
4. Continuous learning mode to add new custom signs
5. Mobile or web integration for remote communication
